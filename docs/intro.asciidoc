Node.js ECS loggers are formatter plugins for your favorite logging libraries.
They make it easy to format your logs into ECS-compatible JSON. In combination
with https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat[filebeat] you can send your
logs directly to Elasticsearch and leverage https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/infrastructure/guide/current/logs-ui-overview.html[Kibana's Logs UI]
to inspect all logs in one single place.

The Node.js ECS logging formatters log structured JSON and support serialization
of Error objects, and HTTP Request and Response objects from Node.js core and
popular web frameworks. A minimal log record includes the following fields:

[source,json]

{
  "@timestamp": "2021-01-13T21:32:38.095Z",
  "log.level": "info",
  "message": "hi",
  "ecs": {"version":"1.5.0"}
}
